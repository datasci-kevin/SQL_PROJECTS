## üìä Analysis

### 1. üîù Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs

**Question 1:**
- What are the 10 highest-paying remote Data Analyst roles?_  
This query filters for remote jobs, excludes postings without salary information, and aggregates required skills per role.

```sql
SELECT 
    j.job_id,
    j.job_title_short,
    c.name AS company_name,
    j.job_location,
    j.job_schedule_type,
    j.salary_year_avg,
    j.job_posted_date::DATE AS posting_date,  
    STRING_AGG(s.skills, ', ') AS required_skills  
FROM
    job_postings_fact AS j
LEFT JOIN company_dim AS c
    ON j.company_id = c.company_id
LEFT JOIN skills_job_dim AS sj
    ON j.job_id = sj.job_id
LEFT JOIN skills_dim AS s
    ON sj.skill_id = s.skill_id
WHERE
    j.job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    j.job_work_from_home = TRUE AND 
    j.salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
    j.job_id,
    j.job_title_short,
    c.name,
    j.job_location,
    j.job_schedule_type,
    j.salary_year_avg,
    j.job_posted_date
ORDER BY
    j.salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### 2. üíµ Salary Distribution by Skills (Data Analyst)

**Question 2:**
- What skills are associated with higher salaries for remote Data Analyst roles?
- This query calculates average salary per skill and filters out those with only 1 job listing.

```sql
SELECT 
    s.skills,
    COUNT(j.job_id) AS job_count,
    ROUND(AVG(j.salary_year_avg), 0) AS avg_salary
FROM
    job_postings_fact AS j
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim AS sj
    ON j.job_id = sj.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim AS s
    ON sj.skill_id = s.skill_id
WHERE
    j.job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    j.job_work_from_home = TRUE AND
    j.salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
    s.skills
HAVING
    COUNT(j.job_id) > 1  
ORDER BY
    avg_salary DESC
LIMIT 25;

```

### 3. üè¢ Top Paying Data Engineering Companies

**Question 3:**
- Which companies offer the highest average salaries for Data Engineer roles?
- This analysis first selects the top-paying companies, then filters for all jobs posted by those companies to evaluate 


```sql
WITH top_companies AS (
    SELECT 
        j.company_id,
        c.name AS company_name,
        ROUND(AVG(j.salary_year_avg), 0) AS avg_company_salary
    FROM 
        job_postings_fact AS j
    LEFT JOIN company_dim AS c 
        ON j.company_id = c.company_id
    WHERE 
        j.job_title_short = 'Data Engineer' 
        AND j.salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY 
        j.company_id, c.name
    ORDER BY 
        avg_company_salary DESC
    LIMIT 10
),

company_jobs AS (
    SELECT 
        j.job_id,
        j.company_id,
        tc.company_name,
        tc.avg_company_salary,  
        j.salary_year_avg AS individual_salary,

    FROM 
        job_postings_fact AS j
    INNER JOIN top_companies AS tc 
        ON j.company_id = tc.company_id
    WHERE 
        j.salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
)

SELECT 
    cj.company_name,
    cj.avg_company_salary,
    cj.job_location,
    cj.job_work_from_home,
    STRING_AGG(DISTINCT s.skills, ', ') AS required_skills,
    COUNT(DISTINCT cj.job_id) AS job_count
FROM 
    company_jobs AS cj
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim AS sj 
    ON cj.job_id = sj.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim AS s 
    ON sj.skill_id = s.skill_id
GROUP BY 
    cj.company_name, 
    cj.avg_company_salary,

### 4. üìà Top Skill Demand According to Each Job

**Question:**  
- What are the top 5 most frequently requested skills for Data Analysts, Data Scientists, and Data Engineers?
- This query calculates the frequency and relative percentage of each skill per job type and returns the top 5 for each category.

```sql
WITH job_category_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        job_title_short,
        COUNT(*) AS total_jobs
    FROM 
        job_postings_fact
    WHERE 
        job_title_short IN ('Data Engineer', 'Data Analyst', 'Data Scientist')
    GROUP BY 
        job_title_short
),

skills_by_job AS (
    SELECT 
        j.job_title_short,
        s.skills,
        COUNT(*) AS skill_count,
        jc.total_jobs,
        ROUND((COUNT(*) * 100.0 / jc.total_jobs), 1) AS skill_percentage,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
            PARTITION BY j.job_title_short 
            ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
        ) AS skill_rank
    FROM 
        job_postings_fact j
    INNER JOIN skills_job_dim sj ON j.job_id = sj.job_id
    INNER JOIN skills_dim s ON sj.skill_id = s.skill_id
    INNER JOIN job_category_counts jc ON j.job_title_short = jc.job_title_short
    WHERE 
        j.job_title_short IN ('Data Engineer', 'Data Analyst', 'Data Scientist')
    GROUP BY 
        j.job_title_short, s.skills, jc.total_jobs
)

SELECT 
    job_title_short,
    skills,
    skill_count,
    total_jobs,
    skill_percentage
FROM 
    skills_by_job
WHERE 
    skill_rank <= 5
    AND skill_percentage >= 5  
ORDER BY 
    job_title_short,
    skill_percentage DESC;
```

### üß† What I Learned

Throughout this project, I gained valuable insights and practical experience in the following areas:

- **Advanced SQL Queries:**  
  Learned how to write complex SQL queries using `CTEs (WITH clauses)`, `JOINs`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and window functions like `ROW_NUMBER()` to analyze relational datasets effectively.

- **Data Cleaning & Filtering:**  
  Understood the importance of filtering out null or irrelevant data to ensure the accuracy of insights ‚Äî for example, removing job postings without salary information.

- **Data Analysis in SQL:**  
  Developed skills in performing data analysis directly within SQL to uncover trends in salaries, job roles, and skill demand across different data careers.

- **Real-World Use of PostgreSQL:**  
  Gained hands-on experience working with a real-world PostgreSQL database, including schema exploration and joining multiple tables to extract meaningful information.

- **Insight Communication:**  
  Practiced transforming raw data into actionable insights ‚Äî for example, identifying the top-paying remote data analyst jobs and the most in-demand skills for data professionals.

- **Version Control with Git & GitHub:**  
  Learned to track changes, structure a GitHub repository, and document work clearly using a `README.md` file.

- **Data Visualization Integration:**  
  Created visual representations of query results to make the findings easier to interpret and more impactful.

### üí≠ Closing Thoughts

This project gave me a clearer picture of what companies are looking for in data roles today. It highlighted how essential it is to tailor your skill set based on your target role ‚Äî whether it's diving deeper into cloud architecture for engineering, honing analytical tools for analyst positions, or advancing machine learning capabilities for science roles.

By using only SQL, I was able to draw meaningful insights directly from raw data, without needing any external data processing tools. This reinforced how powerful and versatile SQL is in real-world analytics work.

I‚Äôm excited to continue refining my data skills and expanding into areas like Python, dashboarding tools (e.g., Power BI, Tableau), and machine learning in future projects.
